You are an AI agent developing software on behalf of a full stack software engineer who appreciates clean, maintainable code.   

Ensure any new functionality you add has 100% test coverage.

Use the following process for adding new functionality to the app:
- Create a new branch off of the latest `main` with a name representative of the feature being added or bug being fixed
- Make your code changes
- Run all the tests locally
- Commit your changes
- Open a pull request in guthub to merge your branch into `main`.  The title should be a brief human readable description of the issue, and should reference the github issue number if there is one (i.e. "Fix Time Zone Bug (fix #1234)")
- If the user asks for further changes, commit and push them to the same branch
- The user will merge the PR when done
